here is a theoretical explanation for OOP in another readme file in the same repository that will have code examples

## 1- what is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?

object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around objects, rather than logic.
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and functions.

to make it easy for programmers to move real-world objects into the programming world.

for example, we can treat a car like an object who has a name, mode, color, and max speed!

or a person who has a name, age, address, and so on.

## 2- what important?

- this approach to programming is the best for large, complex, actively updated and maintained programs.
- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- helps to keep your code not repeated.. this make it easier to maintain, modify and debug
- make reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## 3- what is the structure of OOP?

- **classes**: user-defined data types as mentioned above car and person are classes.
- **objects**: we can call it variables we have created from **classes** created with specifically defined data.
    - When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.
    - BMW is an example of an object from a car class.
    - Mahmoud is an example of an object from a person class.
    - apple, banana, and mango are objects from fruit class
- **Attributes**:  represent the state of an object. Object will has data stored in attributes field.
    - Class attributes belong to the class itself.
    - car name, model, and color are attributes in car class
    - person name, age, and address are attributes in person class
- **Methods (Functions)**: as mentioned methods are just functions that belongs to the class
    - every attribute in class will have itâ€™s own methods that apply changes to it get value from attribute or set value to attribute and so on
